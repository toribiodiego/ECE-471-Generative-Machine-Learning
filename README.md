> This repository contains the code for ECE 471: Generative Machine Learning, a 3-credit interdisciplinary graduate-level course at The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, where architecture, engineering, and art students collaborate to explore and create innovative generative machine learning projects.


## Generative Machine Learning
**Course, Spring 2025**  
**Instructor:** Prof. Sam Keene and Prof. Benjamin Aranda


### Overview

This course delves into the creative and technical dimensions of generative machine learning, emphasizing an interdisciplinary approach that unites art, architecture, and engineering. Students explore and experiment with generative algorithms and machine learning techniques to challenge traditional notions of authorship and design. Through hands-on exercises, collaborative projects, and the curation of unique datasets, participants gain a deep understanding of latent space exploration, algorithmic bias, and the transformation of digital concepts into tangible installations. This immersive experience equips students with both the theoretical insights and practical skills necessary to innovate within the evolving landscape of generative design.

### Final Project
**Project:** Agnes
**Team Members:** Amelia Chan, Era Dogani, Ben Butler, and Diego Toribio

This project uses the Gemini 2.0 Live API to build an interactive installation where users engage with a real-time agent through both speech and a live video stream. The idea is to create a system that listens and responds with dynamic visual feedback, merging state-of-the-art generative machine learning techniques with interactive design.
